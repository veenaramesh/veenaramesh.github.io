I am Veena, a computer scientist and amateur everything else. 

I am currently a professional debugger (aka a GenAI and MLOps Specialist Solutions Architect) at Databricks. We are working on several GenAI solutions-- and actually attempting to make them productionizable. Previously, I was at Lovelytics Data, where I worked directly with clients to shape their ML vision. 

I graduated from the University of Virginia in Computer Science and Linguistics. 

I have a lot of opinions about a lot of things, and I like to write about them.
