hello! I'm Veena, a computer scientist based in D.C. I love art, technology, and the intersection between. 

Currently, I am working in machine learning at Lovelytics, a boutique data consulting company, where I have helped companies optimize and deploy models. We are working on an LLMops framework to help clients properly deploy LLMs to production. 

I graduated from the Univeristy of Virginia, where I studied both computer science and cognitive science with a speciality in linguistics. This cemented my interest in language models.
