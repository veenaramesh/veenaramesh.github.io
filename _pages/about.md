hello! I'm Veena, a computer scientist based in D.C. I love art, technology, and the intersection between. 

Currently, I am a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Lovelytics, a start-up boutique data consulting company.

I graduated from the Univeristy of Virginia, where I studied both computer science and cognitive science with a speciality in linguistics. I love learning languages and learning about languages. Currently, I am attempting to learn how to speak French.
